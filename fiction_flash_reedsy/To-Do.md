“Do you know the difference between a cape and a peninsula? People just say peninsula for everything. Real idiots call an isthmus a peninsula! Crazy, right? But I know the difference. I know a lot of things. I can teach you. We should go out sometime.”

Camille pretended to sip from her cup. The coffee smell lingered though she’d long emptied it, but she knew to throw it away only after this class. With her hands full, she couldn’t shake his hand or return a wave. She hid behind the paper cup and let her silence stretch across the classroom noise of unzipping backpacks and banging metal doors. Rob only smiled wider, showing every tooth. She could feel his stare the same way she could feel an approaching storm. Were there any words, any new words, that would make sense to him?  

“Umm, geography is not really my thing. Like I told you before, no? I just need to focus on this class. Ok, Rob?”  

“Why? It’s just a dumb elective. ‘Memes and Society’. It’s an easy A. Unless…are you struggling? I can tutor you. Let’s partner on this project. I’ll come to your dorm.”  

The paper cup dented under Camille’s thumbs. Did she shake her head ‘no’ too quickly? Her earrings swung, pulling on her ears and bouncing off her neck. The professor rescued her with his claps demanding everyone’s attention. She faced forward and allowed a quick shiver of her shoulders. She could still feel Rob’s eyes and hear his breathing as the professor began his lecture on Man vs Bear.  

“Would you rather be stuck in the woods with a man or a bear? Raise your hand for bear.”  

All the female student’s raised a hand, including Camille. Some of the male students jeered and the debate began but Camille heard only the scoff from behind her and then felt a slight tug on her hair. Automatically, she turned and Rob’s eyes locked on hers.  

“So you like bears better? I know where they are. I can take you to the marsh. And I’ll show you the difference between a marsh and a swamp.”  

Camille retreated forward again. She twirled her hair into a ponytail and pulled it forward over her left shoulder. The ends were choppy. She didn’t remember having that weird gap.  Had she felt something? Was she imagining things?  

Camille grabbed her backpack and rushed down the aisle, putting distance and other students between her and Rob. At first, she’d thought he was just another nerd, not so different from herself. But she wasn’t looking over her shoulder for a nerd. She wasn’t taking the long route to her dorm because of a geek. And she definitely didn’t hide inside the women’s restroom because of some dork.  

To Do:
1.	Drop-off hardware at Geographic Info Systems office.  
2.	Order costume. Overnight delivery!!  
3.	Zipties, assorted sizes! Blanket, ropes, other usual stuff.  
4.	Review trails and pick out spot.  

Rubbing the leaf between her fingers, it felt like plastic, the leaf was that thick and sturdy. Camille didn’t know the names or varieties of any of these trees. But under their canopy and in the shaded, cooler air, she felt both more protected and more alive. These trees had been an unspoken factor in Camille choosing this university. But now standing at the head of this trailway into her favorite forest, it was polluted by an unwelcome voice in her head. That know-it-all voice spouting condescending facts about her forest. The trees gave her peace, and an anger grew at him for intruding on that. A deep voice behind her made her jump and her hand closed on the leaf, ripping it from the tree.  

“Camille – whoa, you ok? Its just me, Michael. I’m sorry.”  

“No, yeah - I’m sorry. I was just stuck in my own head. Weird question, but would you mind walking me back to my dorm? Actually, could we go by your place first? I don’t want to go home right away.”  

Camille ran her fingers through her hair again, lingering on the choppy edges. She had avoided tallying the signs, the red flags. It had been drilled into her to always give the benefit of the doubt. But she was walking with a green flag made flesh. Through middle, high school and now in college, Michael was solid even if he ran in different social circles than Camille. And a guy’s perspective could be good. Camille inhaled and began to tell Michael all that had happened since the first day of the semester.  

His eyebrows arched higher and his frown deeper with each detail. In the apartment, he finally flipped the eyebrows, and they dived down to meet his newly permanent frown. She looked at the famous comedy and tragedy masks hanging on his wall and admired how he had mirrored those expressions. Would Michael’s face ever recover? Camille laughed inwardly even as the meaning sobered her.  

“Camille, you need protection beyond me just walking you home. You may not have pepper spray but I got something. Here – why are you laughing?”  

Camille held the bear spray and giggled at the irony of being given the spray by a man for fear of another man and not a bear. It could be a good angle for her Man vs Bear paper.  

“Michael, you are a theater major who has never once been anywhere without air-conditioning. Where in the world did you get bear spray?”  

“Of course, it’s not mine. It’s my roommate’s. He goes out into the woods all the time. Wait, not woods, marshes. He’s crazy about stuff like that.”  

Marshes. Camille forgot to breathe, and the one closed door in the apartment seemed to double in size. Rob hadn’t been in class today. But Michael’s apartment had been empty when they arrived. No TV murmuring from another room. No footfalls of a grumpy roommate. No echoes of running water in the bathroom. She had assumed they were alone, and now that basic, white door seemed sinister and deceitful. Were those shadows moving on the floor? She removed the safety on the bear spray.  

“Whoa! Camille! You can’t use that indoors!” Michael jumped up from the table as Camille moved towards the bedroom door. “What are you doing?”  

Maps. Maps overlapping other maps covered the walls, with red strings and pushpins marking something. On a drafting table, stacks of how-to books on surveillance and tracking with colorful post-it flags proving they were well-studied. Binoculars, lanterns, ropes, and more items overflowed crates on either side of the table. Outside the one window, Camille noticed the beautiful tree waving its thick leaves in the dying sunlight, throwing shadows over the furniture and across the floor.  

Michael’s voice had turned to white noise as Camille stood by the bedside table. A lock of hair was tied with the same red string as on the walls. She reached one hand up and then down the length of her ponytail to the jagged edge of a missing chunk.  

“I think I know your roomate.”  

The silence from Michael stretched taut before breaking into a rush of memories, down-played comments, dismissed moments. His words pushed Camille out of the room, the apartment, and she rushed down the stairs to stay ahead of them. Michael ran beside her, afraid of all that he too had excused.  

Pumping her arms. Pounding her feet. Panting each breath of cooling air. Her body was doing what her mind could not – something, anything. Branches scratched at her face, and leaves caught in her hair. Michael pulled on her arm, slowing her down, and trying to stop her from running deeper into the forested trail. With Michael as an anchor, she finally fell.  

“Michael, you were not on my to-do list.”  

And there he stood. In a bear onesie costume. 

Her burst of laughter drowned by a wave of nausea. In her mind, Camille saw her childhood room with the trees painted on the walls and her teddy bears arranged for a tea party. In front of her, stubby furry ears and a round potbelly, but Rob’s toothy smile on an unshaven face. In one paw, white ropes and some red string.  

“I had planned for just you and me, Camille. But plans change. And I already made some corrections.”  In his other paw, Rob waved something that Camile prayed was only a taser or a stun gun.  

“Do you recognize where we are, Camille? It’s your desire path. The trail you’ve made on your own, off the official path. In geography, sometimes they’re called erosion paths or pedestrian shortcuts. But I like desire path. We all have our desires. I knew you would come this way, eventually, instinctively.  

This might also be my favorite costume so far. The other girls were much less inspiring.”  

The childish costume was surreal against the million green leaves that hid the three of them.  Rob had taken the beauty of trees from her. He’d taken the sweet memory of a stuffed animal from her. And clearly, he planned to take much more from her.  

“So Camille, let’s find out what happens when you are stuck in the woods with a man and a bear.”  

To Do: 
1.	Give ‘Man vs Bear’ presentation.  
2.	Visit Michael in the hospital.  
3.	Get more pepper spray.  

Camille’s throat still burned, and her hands were red and scaly from the spray. The theater makeup hid the purpling bruises and the scabbed scratches. That had been Michael’s suggestion, to boost her confidence during her speech. Camille flexed her empty hands and shook out the nerves. She pulled her newly styled hair forward and laid it evenly over her shoulders.  

Camille tried on a smile and reached for her phone to take a selfie. The new phone buzzed across the counter, and Camille yanked her hand back as if from a hot stove. Another unknown caller.  

4.	Report calls from prison to DA’s office.  
5.	Move
