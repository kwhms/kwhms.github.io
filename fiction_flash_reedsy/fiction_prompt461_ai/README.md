*In that vein, my challenge for you is not to write an epic sci-fi where an AI overlord takes over the world, or an essay convincing the populace to ditch AI for good, but something far simpler. 
For this contest, let’s write short stories that explore the question: Is artificial intelligence a reflection of human intelligence? And if so, what makes machine different from man?*

1. Center your story around someone who uses technology (AI, hardware, etc.) to write their next work and slowly descends into madness.
2. Write a story where the only character with a name is an artificial being.
3. Using only dialogue, depict a conversation between a non-human entity and a human being about what it means to tell a story, or to be alive.
4. One character is an artificial intelligence. The other is a human being. Your reader must struggle to tell which is which.
5. ***Write a story that includes the line “Are you real?” or “Who are you?”***

In this flash fiction (barely 1k words) I chose prompt 5 and played with these themes:
1. What is intelligence? IQ vs EQ
2. How do we measure intelligence? Diplomas and awards? 
3. So much depends on the inputs - how good are we/AI at collecting the inputs? What are our perceptions?
4. How do we treat family vs strangers vs artificial entities? --> Sibling dynamics.
5. What is a most common human fear? Public speaking.
6. Words as defense and weapons, shield and sword.
7. Are we all victims?
8. In the end, aren't other humans the real danger?
