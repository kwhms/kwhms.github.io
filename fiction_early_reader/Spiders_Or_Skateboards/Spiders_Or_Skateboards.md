# Spiders or Skateboards

"Spiders or skateboards?" asks Sue's brother.  
He is young and asks many funny questions.  
Sue does not know what to say.

"For Dad's birthday. I can give him a spider or a skateboard." he says.

Oh! Sue laughs. She tells him,  
"Spiders and skateboards are cool.  
I know you like them.  
Do you think Dad does too?"

Her brother looks sad.  
"Well, no. He does not."  

Sue smiles at her baby brother,  
"Don't worry.  
I can help you."

Their dad loves sweet foods.  
She puts some candy in a bag.  
"Thank you!" says her brother.

But are these candies good? He eats a pink one. It is great.  
Are the other colors good? He can try them too.  
Oh no, he eats all the candies!

Sue laughs with brother.  
"Don't worry.  
I can help you again."

Their dad plays tennis.  
She puts a new, yellow tennis ball in a box.  
"Thank you, Sue!" says her brother.

But can this ball bounce well? He opens the box and throws the ball.  
Their dog runs for the ball. He catches it in his mouth!  
Oh no, the ball is dirty!

Sue hugs her brother.  
"It's ok."  
But Sue does not know what to do.

She thinks.  
What would their dad like?

"Spiders AND skateboards!" She says.  

Sue tells her brother to wear his favourite spider shirt.  
She asks him to ride his skateboard.  
She gives him Dad's big hat.  
She takes his photo.  
Her small, funny brother looks like their dad.

Their dad loves the photo.  
He laughs when they tell him about the candy and tennis ball.  
Their dad has a very happy birthday.

Her brother gives Sue a drawing.  
It is a drawing of them, brother and sister.  
They wear spider hats and ride skateboards.

"Spiders, skateboards and my sister.  
I like spiders and skateboards,  
but I love my sister."

Sue hugs her brother.  
She is so happy.  
“Thank you. I like to help you, and I love you too.”
