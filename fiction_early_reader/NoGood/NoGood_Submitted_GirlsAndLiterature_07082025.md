# No Good

Her family is good at many things.  
But the girl is not. 

Grandpa makes fantastic food.   
She loves the cakes.  
Big cakes.  
Chocolate cakes.  
Cakes with coconut, mango, or pineapple.  
But her cake is flat. Her cake is not good.

Her brother is great at baseball.  
He picks up the bat.  
He hits the ball into the sky -- hooray!  
His friends clap and jump.  
But her bat is small. She can not run very well. 

Grandma paints beautiful animals.  
The horses look nice.  
The horses look like a photo.   
But she draws with crayons. Her tiger looks like a silly, orange dog.

“Mom, I am no good at things. I try, but I am sad.”

Her mother holds her.  
She says,  
“My love, you are very good at so many things! Let’s see.

You read the cook book for Grandpa.   
You add the eggs.  
You add the milk.  
You know which fruit is sweet.  
This is fantastic.  

You throw and catch the ball for your brother.  
You play baseball with him in the park.  
This is great.

You choose the colours for Grandma’s paintings.  
You choose the blues and reds.  
You choose the yellows and purples.  
This is beautiful.

Do you understand now?  
You do fantastic things.  
You do great things.  
You do beautiful things.”

The girl listens to her mother.  
She looks in the mirror.  
She smiles.  
“Yes, Mom. I see myself. I am good at many things.”
