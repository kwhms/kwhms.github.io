# No Good

The girl’s family is good at many things.  
But the girl feels she is not.

Grandpa makes food.  
He makes chocolate cake.  
He adds coconut.  
He adds mango.  
He adds pineapple.  
It is big. It is sweet. It is good.

But her cake is flat.  
It is not good.  
She feels sad.

Her brother plays baseball.  
He runs. He hits the ball.  
He hits it high in the sky.  
His friends clap. They jump.  
“Hooray\!” they say.

But her bat is small.  
She can not run fast.  
She feels sad.

Grandma paints animals.  
Her horse is big.  
Her horse looks real.  
It looks like a photo.

But the girl draws a tiger.  
She uses a crayon.  
The tiger looks like a dog.  
Not a good one.  
She feels sad.

She goes to her mom.  
She says,  
“Mom, I am no good at things.”  
“I try, but I feel sad.”

Mom gives her a hug.  
Mom smiles.  
She says,  
“You do good things.  
Let’s see…”

“You read the cooking book for Grandpa because he cannot see it.  
You add the eggs.  
You add the milk.  
You add the sweet fruits.  
That is fantastic.”

“You throw the ball to your brother.  
You play with him in the park.  
That is great.”

“You help Grandma paint.  
You pick the colours.  
Red, blue, yellow, purple.  
That is beautiful.”

Mom says,  
“You think it is no good.  
But it is fantastic.  
It is great.  
It is beautiful.”

The girl listens.  
She looks in the mirror.  
She smiles.

She says,  
“Yes, Mom. I see now.  
I am good at many things.”
