# Tailspin


*Misery is neither created nor destroyed but transferred from one body to another.* Ok - my misery must be transferred to somebody. Some body. I made the deal with the devil and thought I had outsmarted him.  

My parent's little dog was a some body. A little, squiggly body of joy with no worries.  Praised, admired, and loved on every hour of his waking day. Yes, I envied the dog, but that is not why I chose him. My human miseries would be a small splash in the sea of his blissful ignorance.  

With the deal done, I extended my arms and spun in circles the same as if I were a child again. I laughed when I learned the little dog was spinning too. He chased his tail -- a cute cliché!  

But then he began drawing blood and ripping out hairs, giving himself a patchy rat tail.  When behaviorists and veterinarians failed to help, my parents amputated his tail. But he continued chasing the phantom tail.  

I began to chew my fingernails raw again, and I crossed the street rather than pass a dog. I awoke at 3am, plotting new deals to save this disfigured dog.  Misery had come back to me and left a cruel wake. My parents had abandoned their previously perfect pet.  

At the shelter, he greeted me with whole-body wiggles and spun after the phantom tail. I sat on the concrete and the dog twirled into my lap, all chaos and no judgement. I made a deal with that dog, and we went home again.  

A knock at the door or the churn of the ice machine triggered his tailspins. Certain phone calls or dollar amounts triggered mine. We learned to interrupt the other’s spiral, and in each other’s company, our misery was less.
