# Fur Dries Tears Best

For 8 years she had desperately wanted to be human but now was at peace being herself, a good dog. She calmly leaned into the little girl’s grip, feeling her despair. The tears fell onto the white fur, and the girl hiccupped her name, Sugar.  

The dog had grown up with the human babies, witnessed them grow taller and stronger while the parents remained unchanged. Immortal beings who balanced on two legs and threw balls. How marvelously mysterious they were!  

But not all mysteries are marvelous.  

She heard the low rumble of the engines well before the trucks pulled up to her home. Masked strangers shouted unfamiliar words – immigration, papers, illegal. They grabbed at her family, breaking them apart. The base smell of human fear hung heavily in the air. The strangers shoved her humans into the trucks, muffling their frantic cries and pleas. The engines roared, and her family disappeared.  

Left behind, her hot barks fogged the windows, and she clawed the walls in frustration. No food, no water, no one. For too long.  

Reunited now with her little girl, the dog snuffled her clothes but found no familiar scents of their human pack. The girl hadn’t seen them in a while either then. The dog no longer envied humans. They were not so kind or clever after all. Perhaps that is why they must live so long -- to learn what all dogs instinctively know.  

The girl stroked the white fur, and her voice broke on “Good dog, Sugar” before she disappeared again.  

Years later, the young woman threw a ball for her beloved dog. She called Honey back to her and pressed her face into the golden neck. Life would continue to break her heart, but the woman also knew that fur dries tears best.
