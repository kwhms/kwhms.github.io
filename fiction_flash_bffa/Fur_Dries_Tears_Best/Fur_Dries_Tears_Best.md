# Fur Dries Tears Best

For 8 years she had desperately wanted to be a little girl but now she was content to be herself – a good dog. The little human cried her despair into the dog’s white fur and hiccupped her name, Sugar. No one but this dog could console the girl.  

She had grown up with the human babies, witnessed them grow taller and stronger while the parents remained unchanged. Immortal beings who balanced on two legs and threw balls. How marvelously mysterious they were!  

But not all mysteries are marvelous.  

She heard the engines well before the trucks pulled up to the house. All that came next confused her. She saw the strangers wave firearms, their faces covered by masks. They yelled unfamiliar words -- immigration, papers, illegal. She smelled her family’s fear and heard their pleas while the strangers tore them from each other. They disappeared into the trucks.  
 
Left behind, her hot barks fogged the windows, and she clawed the walls in frustration. No food, no water, no one. For too long.  

Reunited now with her little human, the dog snuffled the girl’s clothes but found no familiar scents of their human pack. The girl hadn’t seen them in a while either then. The dog no longer envied humans. They were not so kind or clever after all. Perhaps that is why they must live so long -- to learn what all dogs instinctively know.  

The girl stroked the white fur, and her voice broke on “Good girl, Sugar” before she disappeared again.  

Years later, the young woman threw a ball for her beloved dog. She called Honey back to her and pressed her face into the golden neck. The woman knew life was full of heartbreak, but life had also taught her fur dries tears best.
