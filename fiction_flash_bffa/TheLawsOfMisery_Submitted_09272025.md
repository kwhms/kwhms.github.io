# The Laws of Misery

*Misery is neither created nor destroyed but transferred from one body to another*. The devil’s clean hands tapped the paper in front of me. *“Name somebody”*. One body. Some body.  
  
My parents’ little dog was a some body. A squiggly body of empty-headed joy.  Loved on every hour of his waking day. Maybe I envied the dog, but that is not why I chose him. My human miseries would be a small splash in his sea of ignorant innocence. I named him and traded in my misery.  
  
A blissful world revolved around me. Golden days blurred into silver nights, and time turned uncounted. The pup mindlessly chased his tail in a world of his own. I laughed at the harmless obsession and congratulated myself on my clever choice of innocent.  
  
Until the day he began to rip out hairs and drip blood, squealing in a tailspin of self-mutilation. Even after amputation, the disfigured creature continued the miserable phantom chase. Until my parents abandoned my innocent some body.  
  
Guilt woke me at 3am and shame dogged my steps during the day. I chewed my fingernails raw again, the strips of skin catching on my clothing. I screamed in my mind, to the devil’s delight.  
  
*Misery escapes, expands, and is unbound*. His perfect hands traced the back side of the paper. It had not been a loophole, but a trick. *“Name somebody”*, baited the devil. I told myself a paper has no third side. I could beat his two laws. Not an innocent, but an enemy this time. I printed so precisely and closed the deal.  
  
The world crystallized around me and time chilled to a halt. The devil’s fine fingers held an envelope.  My eyes bleed to read the writing. A third law coldly sealed my foolish, final misery!
