Maya’s family is good at many things.  
But Maya feels she is not.

Grandpa cooks food.  
He makes chocolate cake.  
He adds coconut.  
He adds mango.  
He adds pineapple.

It is big.   
It is sweet.   
It is good.

But Maya’s cake is flat.  
It is not good.  
Maya feels sad.

Her brother plays baseball.  
He runs.   
He hits the ball.  
He hits it high in the sky\!

His friends clap.   
They jump.  
“Hooray\!” they say.

But Maya’s bat is small.  
She cannot run fast.  
Maya feels sad.

Grandma paints animals.  
Her horse is big.  
Her horse looks real.  
It looks like a photo.

Maya draws a tiger.  
She uses a crayon.  
But the tiger looks like a dog.  
Maya feels sad.

Maya goes to her mom.  
“Mom, I am no good at things.  
I try, but I feel sad,” she says.

Mom gives her a hug.  
Mom smiles.  
She says,  
“You do good things.  
Let’s see…”

“You read the cooking book for Grandpa.  
He cannot see it.  
You add the eggs.  
You add the milk.  
You add the sweet fruits.  
That is fantastic.”

“You throw the ball to your brother.  
You play with him in the park.  
That is great.”

“You help Grandma paint.  
You pick the colours.  
Red.  
Blue.   
Yellow.   
Purple.  
That is beautiful.”

Mom says,  
“You think it is no good.  
But it is fantastic.  
It is great.  
It is beautiful.”

The girl listens.  
She looks in the mirror.  
She smiles.

She says,  
“Yes, Mom. I see now.  
I am good at many things.”
