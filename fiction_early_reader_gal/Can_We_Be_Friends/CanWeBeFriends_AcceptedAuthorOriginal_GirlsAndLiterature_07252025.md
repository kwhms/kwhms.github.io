# Can we be Friends

Sue is new in school.  
I do not know Sue.  
But I hope we can be friends. 

I ask her to play at my house.  
I tell her,  
“I like big animals like tigers and bears.   
I read about them.  
I watch them on TV.  
Do you like them too?”  

“Oh, no!” She says. 
“They are scary.  
I like small animals.  
Animals that are in the garden.  
I like frogs and birds.  
My favourite bird is a robin.” 

But I do not like small animals very much.  

I show her my paintings.  
I tell her,  
“My favourite color is blue, like the water and the sky.  
I paint with lots of blues.  
Do you like blue too?”  

“It is ok.” She says.  
“I like yellow.  
Yellow like the sun or a baby duck.”  

But I do not like yellow so much.  

I look at Sue again.  
Her hair is long and black.  
My hair is short and brown.  
Her shoes are clean.  
My shoes are dirty.  

I feel sad. What if we can not be friends?  
But Sue is very nice. I try again.  

I ask Sue, “Do you like ice cream?”  

“Oh, no!” She says. “I LOVE ice cream!”  

I clap my hands – hooray!  
Does Sue like cake? Yes!!  
Does Sue like candy? Yes!!  
Does Sue like chocolate? Double yes!!  

We play in the garden.  
Both our shoes are dirty now.  
We look for green lizards and yellow bees.  

I point to a bird in the sky.  
Sue tells me about robins.  
A robin egg is a special blue.  
She says I would love that blue.   

Mom gives us chocolate ice cream.  
We sit under the blue sky and yellow sun.  
We are happy.

We are friends.
