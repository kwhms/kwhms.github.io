# Can we be Friends

Sue is a new girl at school.  
I do not know Sue.  
But I want to be friends.  

“Let’s play at my house!” I say.  
“Okay,” Sue says.    

We talk at my house.  

“I like big animals!” I say.  
“I like tigers and bears.  
I read about them.  
Do you like big animals?”    

“No!” Sue says.  
“They are scary.  
I like small animals.  
I like frogs and birds.”    

“I do not like small animals,” I say.    

“I like to paint!” I say.  
“My favorite color is blue.  
Do you like blue?”    

“It is okay,” Sue says.  
“I like yellow.”    

“I do not like yellow,” I say.  
I look at Sue.    

Her hair is long and black.  
My hair is short and brown.  
Her shoes are clean.  
My shoes are dirty.    

I feel sad.  
‘What if we cannot be friends?’ I think.  

But Sue is nice.  
I will try again.  

“Do you like ice cream?” I ask.  
“I LOVE ice cream!” Sue says.  

I clap my hands.  
Hooray!  

“Do you like cake?” I ask.  
“Yes!” Sue says.  
Hooray!  

“Do you like chocolate?” I ask.  
“Yes!” Sue says.  
Hooray!  

We play in the garden.  
Now both our shoes are dirty.  

“Let’s look for animals!” I say.  

We find blue birds.  
We find yellow animals.    

Mom gives us chocolate ice cream.  
We are happy.  
We are friends.
