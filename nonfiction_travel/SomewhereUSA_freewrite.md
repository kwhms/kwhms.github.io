Uniform rows of horse-stables, each row slightly more elevated than the previous because the tan land is on the side of a big hill.

All around is the uniform tan color with pops of color from people and horses.



The cold air stings my nose.  
My lips are chapped.  
Neither I nor the horses are dressed for this weather.



There was a field of tulips on the way to the arena.



It feels vast, unlike suburban South Florida - green, humid, concrete, flat.



I hear the wind.  
I smell the horses, always, and hear their chuffing and movements.



I run freely all around and am unmonitored (as far as I know) by adults.



I feel like I could soar off the ground of one of these rows and fly above the tan landscape back to that tulip field.
