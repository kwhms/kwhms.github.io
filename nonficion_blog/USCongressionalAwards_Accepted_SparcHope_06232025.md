# US Congressional Awards Program: An Accessible and Reputable Resource for High Schoolers

The high-school years can feel especially high stakes. Parents feel the pressure to guide and empower our teens for success in college and adulthood. Countless organizations advertise programs but then have deal-breaking requirements or costs. Fortunately, there is a super accessible resource with a stellar reputation: the US Congressional Awards Program.



In fact, this non-partisan program is **the highest honor the US Congress bestows on youth civilians!** And it is open to young people of all ability, circumstance and socioeconomic status. Its mission is *"…for young people to unleash their potential by achieving personal goals focused on volunteerism, character development, and fitness".* A pretty accurate reflection of what many parents hope for their high schoolers!



There are three participation requirements:



1. Be between the ages of 14 to 24.
2. Pay a one-time registration fee of $35
3. Identify an unrelated adult advisor to mentor the participant.



All activities are completely voluntary, non-competitive and non-partisan. The idea is for teens to focus on self-improvement by setting incremental goals and then working at their own pace. The program recognizes their achievements with awards of bronze, silver, and gold certificates or medals.



Participants set goals in each of four categories:



1. **Voluntary Public Service** – Giving back to the community through unpaid service.
2. **Personal Development** – Exploring new interests or deepening existing skills.
3. **Physical Fitness** – Improving health and physical performance.
4. **Expedition/Exploration** – Planning and completing an adventure or cultural experience.



Your teen’s current interests probably already align with these categories. By participating in this program, they learn to set SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely.



For a bronze certificate, the first level, a dedicated basketball player might set:



1. A Voluntary Public Service goal to volunteer 30 hours coaching at a youth basketball league.
2. A Personal Development goal to maintain a 3.0 GPA through weekly study sessions, totaling 15 hours.
3. A Physical Fitness goal to improve their vertical jump through weekly plyometric drills, totaling 15 hours
4. An Expedition/Exploration goal to organize a 1-day team hike in a nearby state park.
5. 

Subsequent levels require more hours, with the highest gold medal level requiring over 800 total hours.



In their last impact statement, the US Congressional Awards program reported 50,763 participants and 7,633 awards earned. Of that, 8,071 were new registrations and 1,577 bronze certificates.



Would your teen like to be part of that next impact report?  If yes, check out www.congressionalaward.org for more information and best wishes as you guide your high schooler to unleash their potential.
