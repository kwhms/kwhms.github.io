# Jump Rope: The Surprising Workout for Parents

Does jump rope stir nostalgic memories of playing at recess or watching Rocky movies? Much more than bygone recollections, jump rope is the surprising workout that conveniently adapts to modern parenting life. 

The only requirements are 1 rope and enough space to swing it. No expensive, complicated or space-hogging equipment. Workout at home and at any convenient time. No gym memberships, personal trainers or class schedules.

## How good is the workout?

This childhood toy is today’s full-body, cardio-burning workout. Just 10 minutes of jump rope match 30 minutes of jogging for cardiovascular benefits. Every swing and jump engage lower, mid, and upper body muscles: calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes, core, shoulders, and arms! As a weight-bearing exercise, it strengthens bone density and helps prevent osteoporosis. There is good reason real-life boxers and athletes use jump ropes in their training – it improves coordination, timing, and agility.

## How convenient is it?

This impressive range of physical benefits all in a workout that instantly fits into our challenging and chaotic schedules. Young children’s nap time or favorite cartoon shows are opportunities to sneak in that workout. No need to wait for a sitter or face the Herculean task of leaving the house.  When we do have to hit the road, ropes pack easily and we can squeeze in a workout at our kids’ sporting events, scouting trips, or family vacations. Perhaps best of all, the fixed location of a jump rope workout translates into more security and safety. Our family knows just where we are, and we can respond immediately to the unexpected, such as a toddler's nap ending early or a middle-schooler's injury during soccer practice. 

## Any other benefits?

Stressed parents will appreciate the mental benefits of jump rope. The rhythm and repetition can become meditative, calming our noisy thoughts. And yet, it’s also fun! We can play like kids again by learning new steps and tricks. It is a rewarding confidence boost to unlock a new skill like boxer-step, side swing or double-unders.
