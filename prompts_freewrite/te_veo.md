###### Write a poem about how one important person in your life (past or present) sees you!

# Te Veo
    
Mi nieta, mi corazón.  
I see you from this other side,  
And I miss you much.  
  
I see you working the words,  
In english and in español,  
And it is good work.  
  
I see you still so skinny,  
Still so wild,  
Still so smart.  
  
It gives me happiness  
that you are so.  
  
I see you are free,  
Like all you Americans think.  
But not free,  
Like all we women know.  
  
It gives me pain  
That you have new words,  
But we have no time.  
  
I see you moving closer,  
And working to fix  
What you did not break.  
  
It gives me happiness  
To see you so.  
Te quiero.
