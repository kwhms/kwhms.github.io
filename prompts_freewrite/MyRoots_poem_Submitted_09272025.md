# My Roots

Every few weeks,  
I see those sneaks.  
Edging, creeping, revealing,  
My denial stealing.  
  
I want to wait,  
to push out the date.  
I have many things to curate.  
Important thoughts to ruminate.  
The pressure of memories to create.  
And above all, the loss of time is what I hate.  
  
So in the in-between,  
I keep the sneaks unseen.  
In the first hours, I paint with powders.  
But there are days, I switch to sprays.  
Regardless of the chosen mean, my roots eventually make a scene.  
  
Now how to circumvent the growing gray?  
Well Grandma she went white straight away.  
And Mom has spent on a blonde charade.  
While I augment with a brownish shade.  
  
Even if it is just hair, still arrives that moment  
when the question comes to bear: cover it or own it?  
And I guess, I should confess I'm under no duress  
when I decide to break on the side of color, conceal, and hide.  
  
Then when it's said and done,  
And another 4 weeks respite are won,  
I look in the mirror,  
Lean in nearer,  
Wonder why I sometimes fear her,  
Strain to see her clearerâ€¦  
  
She looks back from afar,  
I welcome her "Ah, there you are."
